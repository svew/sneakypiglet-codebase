    ingredients:
      - 1 1/2 oz brandy or bourbon
      - 3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
      - 1/4 ounce Hunt + Alpine Cardamom-Coriander Syrup (see Editor's Note)
      - 1/2 ounce ginger syrup (see Editor's Note)
    steps:
      - Preheat a glass mug by filling it with hot water. Leave the water in for now and set it aside.
      - To prepare the drink, you'll want a heat-conducting vessel that fits into a second container. Two metal mixing tins work great. Fill the first with enough hot water that the second container floats in the water when placed inside the first. Essentially, you are creating a small bain-marie to preheat the ingredients without diluting them.
      - Add the brandy or bourbon, lemon juice, cardamom-coriander syrup, and ginger syrup to your mixing tins and stir gently until heated through.
      - Empty the water from the preheated mug and immediately fill it with the heated cocktail.
      - Top with 3 ounces of hot water. Express the orange twist over the drink, and place the cinnamon stick into the drink.

  - name: Cardamom-Coriander Syrup
    ingredients:
      - 2 cinnamon sticks, broken up
      - 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds
      - 1 tablespoon black cardamom pods
      - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
      - 4 ounces high-proof rum
      - 15 ounces hot water
      - 3/4 cup fine granulated sugar
    notes: |
        Preheat the oven to 450°F. 
        Spread the cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, and cardamom on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing occasionally to prevent burning, until fragrant but not burned, about 8 minutes.
        Combine the toasted spices, red pepper flakes, and rum in a blender, and blend on high speed until evenly ground, about 2 minutes.
        Meanwhile, in a separate container, combine the hot water and sugar, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
        Set aside.
        Using a coffee filter or multiple layers of cheesecloth, strain the spice and rum mixture into the sugar syrup.
        Stir to combine.
        Transfer to a clean, sealable bottle or container.
        This syrup will keep, refrigerated, for 2 months.
        Shake thoroughly before using.
        As a substitute for the cardamom-coriander syrup, Volk recommends using 1/4 ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram and 1 teaspoon of rich simple syrup (2:1, sugar:water).

    notes: For this nonalcoholic highball, I wanted to make a savory-yet-fruity cordial that used tea as a way to balance the sugar and let its tannic, bitter qualities create balance. Fresh bay leaves taste and smell just like Lipton iced tea, so it naturally plays really well with the black tea. -TB
    ingredients:
      - 2 ounces cold seltzer
      - 4 ounces Alpenglow Cordial
      - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
      - Garnish: 1 fresh bay leaf
    steps:
      - Pour the seltzer into a Collins glass. Short shake the remaining ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into the glass. Fill the glass with ice cubes and garnish with the bay leaf.

    notes: I get a lot of inspiration from culinary sources. There’s a recipe in the Alinea cookbook made with corn, coconut, and cayenne, so I wanted to make a highball around those flavors. Mezcal Vago Elote is a triple-distilled mezcal macerated with corn, so it tastes a bit like cooked corn. -MB
    ingredients:
      - 1 ounce Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend scotch
      - 1 ounce Mezcal Vago Elote
      - 1 teaspoon Cane Sugar Syrup
      - ½ teaspoon lactart
      - ½ dash Bitter End Moroccan bitters
      - 4 ounces Harmless Harvest coconut water
      - Garnish: 1 grapefruit twist
    steps:
      - Chill all the ingredients. Combine them in a carbonating bottle, charge with CO2, and gently shake to help dissolve the CO2 into the liquid. Refrigerate the carbonating bottle for at least 20 minutes, and preferably for 12 hours, before opening. Pour into a fizz glass and fill with ice cubes. Express the grapefruit twist over the drink, then place it into the drink.

    notes: The goal with this drink was to create something that felt sophisticated and really focused on French ingredients. It’s got loads of apple and grape flavors, and the small dash of celery bitters helps ground all of that fruit and complements the bitter Suze. -TB
    ingredients: 
     - 2 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - 1½ ounces Domaine du Manoir de Montreuil calvados
     - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - ½ ounce Jean-Luc Pasquet Pineau des Charentes
     - ½ ounce Suze
     - ½ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
     - 1 dash Bitter Truth celery bitters
    steps:
     - Pour the sparkling wine into a chilled flute. Shake the remaining ingredients with ice, then double strain into the flute. No garnish.

    notes: I created this drink when working on my first Death & Co. menu. We were down to the wire and needed a sparkling wine drink. Rose water and champagne is a classic flavor combination. Many drinks take a lot of tweaking to get them to the point where they work; this spec was my first pass, and it was approved right off the bat. That was a huge confidence-building moment for me. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 2 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - 1 cucumber slice
     - 1 ¼ ounces Campo de Encanto Acholado pisco
     - ¼ ounce Clear Creek Williams pear brandy
     - ¾ ounce Grapefruit Cordial
     - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - 3 drops rose water
    steps:
      - Pour the sparkling wine into a chilled flute. In a shaker, gently muddle the cucumber. Add the remaining ingredients and shake with ice, then double strain into the flute. No garnish.

    notes: This is based on a classic spritz called the Bicicletta. Fennel and citrus is a well-trod culinary combination executed in cocktail form, and the fennel-flavored liqueur from the Don Ciccio guys is a fun flavor to play around with in drinks. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce cold seltzer
     - 2 ounces dry sparkling wine
     - 1 ¼ ounces St. George Bruto Americano
     - ½ ounce Don Ciccio & Figli Finocchietto fennel liqueur
     - 1 teaspoon Giffard crème de pamplemousse rose
     - Garnish: 1 grapefruit half wheel
    steps:
      - Pour the seltzer into a chilled wine glass filled with ice cubes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir briefly to combine. Garnish with the grapefruit half wheel.

    notes: This drink was on one of our first “luxury” menu sections, in which most of the drinks are big, spirituous cocktails that showcase aged spirits. Here, I wanted something that shows off the absurdly delicious Cyril Zangs 00 apple cider eau-de-vie. The rhum agricole lifts up the grassy aromas, and the whole thing tastes like biting into a Granny Smith apple on steroids. -TB

    notes: Copenhagen-based Empirical Spirits makes this really cool vapor-distilled spirit which has the intensely floral flavor of habanero chiles but none of the heat. It reminded me of guava, so I took the recipe for a classic Mexican Firing Squad and swapped in the habanero spirit for tequila, and guava syrup for grenadine. There’s a tradition in tiki drinks for naming them after doctors; this one is a nod to a G.I. Joe villain. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce Tapiatio 110-proof tequila
     - ½ ounce Tapatio Blanco tequila
     - ½ ounce Empirical Spirits Habanero Spirit

     - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
     - Garnish: 1 lime wheel

    notes: Everyone at Death & Co. loves Clear Creek pear eau-de-vie, but it's extra special to me. The first time I injured myself at work (I sliced my finger on a vegetable peeler), I was nursing my wound in the back, and Alex Day brought me a glass of Clear Creek eau-de-vie to cheer me up. That’s when I fell in love with the product. I based this low-ABV drink on the combination of pear and fennel; the rest of the ingredients fell into place to make a beautiful highball. -AH

    notes: Spritzes usually get locked into a box of bitter, fruity, and bubbly, so Jon and I wanted to show a different side of the Spritz. We also really wanted to get Riesling into a cocktail, so we amplified the subtle dill flavors in Riesling with Svöl aquavit, which is very dill-driven, and then we layered on the malic-acid characteristic of the Leopold sour apple. -AJ

    notes: The addition of shiso and pear-flavored spirits makes this more interesting than the standard Japanese highball. If you don’t want to carbonate this in a whipper, you can freeze a batch of everything but the seltzer, then top it off with seltzer to serve. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 4 ½ ounces cold seltzer
     - 1½ ounces Suntory Toki Japanese Whisky
     - ½ ounce Glasshouse shiso brandy
     - ¼ ounce Mathilde Poire pear liqueur
     - 1 teaspoon Clear Creek Williams pear brandy
     - ¼ ounce simple syrup
     - ½ teaspoon Malic Acid solution
     - Garnish: 1 shiso leaf
    steps:
      - Chill all the ingredients. Combine them in a carbonating bottle, charge with CO2, and gently shake to help dissolve the CO2 into the liquid. Refirgerate the carbonating bottle for at least 20 minutes, and preferably for 12 hours, before opening. Pour into a Collins glass and fill the glass with ice cubes. Garnish with the shiso leaf.

    notes: This is an elevated gin and tonic riff that includes the grapefruit and maraschino duo from a Hemingway Daiquiri, with some Douglas Fir eau-de-vie for pineyness. At the bar we carbonated and bottled each serving of the drink, which was such a pain in the ass to do. The juice wasn’t worth the squeeze, as they say, so it makes more sense to build it in a Collins glass. -JA

While most Old Cubans are made with dark rum, I tried it with younger and younger rums before settling on a white rum, which led to a comparatively more simple drink, but definitely a crowd-pleaser.

    notes: I learned to appreciate the simplicity of highballs when I worked at an izakaya, so I wanted to create a drink in that style. The name actually came to me first: "Shoganai" is Japanese slang that doesn't have an English equivalent, but is a way of saying "it can't be helped" or "I'm throwing in the towel." Ironically, the drink took a lot of collaboration to create. Making a highball with champagne instead of soda is complicated, as the wine adds a lot of flavor. The cider was a curveball, too; it was added after Tyson asked "What about Japanese whisky, champagne, and apples?" -DA

     - 1 ounce Hibiki Japanese Harmony whisky

    notes: Tyson likes to name cocktails after Westerns, so this cocktail pokes fun at that (Silverheels was the last name of the actor who played Tonto). This is a beer cocktail made with ingredients I love, with the pineapple and crushed ice adding a tiki element. -JF

     - 2 ounces dry apple cider 
     - 1 ounce High West Silver oat whiskey
     - 1 ounce Clear Creek 2-year apple brandy

     - ½ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
     - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - 2 dashes Bittermens 'Elemakule tiki bitters
     - Garnish: 1 apple slice and 1 mint bouquet
    steps:
      - Pour the cider into a pilsner glass. Combine the remaining ingredients in a shaker and whip, shaking with a few pieces of crushed ice, just until incorporated. Dump into the glass and fill the glass with crushed ice. Garnish with the apple slice and mint bouquet and serve with a straw.

    notes: Another one in our ongoing series of tiki drinks named after "doctors." Amrut is a very tasty, very strong whisky from India that has tropical fruit notes. Other than that, it's similar to a Doctor Funk, a 1953 Don the Beachcomber classic. -MB
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce Amrut cask-strength single-malt Indian whisky
     - ½ ounce El Dorado 15-year Demerara rum 
     - ½ ounce Batavia arrack
     - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice 
     - ¾ ounce House Grenadine
     - 6 dashes absinthe
     - Garnish: 1 orchid flower
    steps:
      - Short shake all the ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into a Collins glass. Fill the glass with crushed ice and garnish with the orchid.

    notes: This no-ABV, Daiquiri-style cocktail uses Seedlip Spice 94 as its base. I like the Seedlip line of nonalcoholic spirits a lot, but they don't have much texture, so I added a good amount of pineapple juice to beef it up. -AG
    ingredients:
     - 1½ ounces Seedlip Spice 94
     - 1½ ounces fresh pineapple juice 
     - 1 ounce fresh lime juice

    notes: This was my first Death & Co. spec, and the one I'm most proud of. It's based on the Infante, a classic tequila drink that's basically a tequila Daiquiri with orgeat as the sweetener. In this variation I split the base between brandy and rum to bring an autumnal flavor profile to an otherwise summery cocktail. (You can also use Cobrafire eau-de-vie de raisin in place of the Armagnac.) -DA
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce Domaine d'Espérance blanche Armagnac
     - ¾ ounce Rhum JM Blanc
     - ¼ ounce Avuá Amburana cachaça 
     - 1 ounce fresh lime juice
     - ¾ ounce House Orgeat 
     - 4 dashes St. Elizabeth allspice dram 
     - Garnish: Nutmeg
    steps:

Celery is one of my favorite savory elements to use in drinks; it's fresh and light, and can work with both savory and spicy flavors. -SP

They age this whiskey for more than a decade, then finish it in marcan barrels, which results in a novel flavor and aroma.

    notes: No-ABV drinks can be challenging. Ingredients interact differently than they do in drinks with alcohol. I looked to Hawaii to inspire this summery drink.

It sounds sweet, but it goes down easy. -JF

    notes: Yuzu have this intense acidity and an incredible salty-savory flavor, but they are also very aromatic and floral. Sometimes the creative process can be informed by trying to fill gaps, and Death & Co. hadn't put out many yuzu drinks. I tried to keep this "luxury" cocktail simple to honor the Nikka whisky, which has a nuttiness that's accented by the orgeat. The name is a reference to Navajo rug making and this idea that the weavers purposefully mess up one little corner of their beautiful, complicated rugs, because a perfect thing is not a living thing. To me, every drink is imperfect, which means we can always revisit and rethink our work. -SJ

    notes: I put this drink up to Matt Belanger, and he said, “Oh, this has all the Shannon things.” One of those “things” is the combination of scotch and Wray & Nephew rum, which I wanted to work into a whiskey sour variation. I also wanted to incorporate strawberries and olive oil, so a touch of soy lecithin keeps the oil in suspension. If you don't have any soy lecithin, add an egg white to the drink and dry shake it first. -ST

     - Combine all the ingredients in a julep tin and fill the tin about halfway with crushed ice. Holding the tin by the rim, stir, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds. Add more crushed ice to fill the tin about two-thirds full and stir until the tin is completely frosted. Add more ice to form a cone above the rim. Garnish with the pineapple slice and mint bouquet and grate some coffee over the top of the drink. Serve with a straw.

    notes: This is my take on a more bitter and complex sherry cobbler. A tiny amount of Zangs 00 cider eau-de-vie works wonders and makes the drink taste like my mom's apple crisp. The garnish is lavish, but a reminder that cobblers should be exciting and a little over the top. -DA
    ingredients:
     - 1 lemon coin (a quarter-size piece of rind with some flesh attached) 
     - 1 orange half wheel
     - 1½ ounces Lustau manzanilla sherry
     - 1 ounce Bonal Gentiane-Quina 
     - ½ ounce Amaro Nonino

     - ¼ ounce Cinnamon Syrup
     - Garnish: 1 mint bouquet, 1 orange half wheel, 1 apple slice, powdered sugar, and 1 cinnamon stick
    steps:
     - In a shaker, gently muddle the lemon coin and orange half wheel. Add the remaining ingredients and whip, shaking with a few pieces of crushed ice, just until the ingredients are incorporated. Strain into a julep tin and fill the tin with crushed ice. Insert the mint bouquet, orange half wheel, and apple slice into the ice; dust the top of the garnishes with powdered sugar and grated cinnamon.

    notes: Here, I'm trying to make a Toronto with Mexican ingredients. Vallet, Mexican fernet, is very dry and astringent, like trying to eat a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. I combine our macadamia nut syrup with macadamia liqueur; this is something I do frequently, as the syrup doesn't have much aroma, so when used in tandem they complete the circle of macadamia nut. -SJ
    ingredients:
     - 2 ounces Siete Leguas Añejo tequila

    notes: This is the whiskey and aged-rum drinker's pinnacle, full of base tone flavors. Even though there's more whiskey in the build, the drink is really more about the rum, which is so intense you don't need much of it. PX sherry adds extra texture and sweetness, and the rum just sucks that right up. -SJ

The pear eau-de-vie gives it all a bit of roundness, but you don't detect the pear in the final drink, which is a great example of how pear can improve a drink in the background. -MB

    notes: After Japanese whisky started to get really popular but before they clamped down on allocations, we'd buy every bottle of Yamazaki that we could get our hands on. By the time this drink went on the menu, we were sitting on a massive stockpile of the stuff. This was the most expensive cocktail on the menu, but we sold the shit out of it. If you can't find Yamazaki, use Santori Toki or Nikka Coffey Grain in its place, and it will be almost as good. -MB

    notes: This was my favorite Death & Co. spec, and it pretty much wrote itself. Jon Armstrong created the habanero tincture as a way to add spice to drinks without having to use jalapeño-infused tequila. As for the peanut butter-infused rye - a lot of people taste peanuts in Old Overholt, so I amped that up with a fat-wash infusion, then augmented it with a smoky, chocolaty mezcal. Peanut butter loves honey, so honey syrup became the sweetener. We sold so many of this cocktail, because it contains a trifecta of ingredients that makes guests think "I have to have that." -JW

I first brought the drink to a tasting as a Bamboo, then we made it into a sour, then it became a Collins, then we circled back to the original Bamboo build. -JT

    notes: It's ironic that Old-Fashioned style cocktails are usually our most popular drinks, but often the last ones developed for a menu. Here, I started with a Toki Highball, Japan's most notable cocktail, and started deconstructing it. Toki whisky is a young blend with lots of pear, honey, and rose on the nose; Bertoux adds nuances of juicy stone fruit that intensify those flavors, while the Caol Ila pushes the Toki's subtle smoky notes. Our original intention was to add seltzer and make this into a highball, but we realized that the drink was better without bubbles. -JT

     - 1½ ounces Suntory Toki Japanese whisky

    notes: This drink was all about the corn-infused mezcal. By toasting dried corn husks and making a sous-vide infusion, the husks not only accentuate the roasted flavor of the agave but also add an almost mineral spiciness to the mezcal. Chichicapa tastes like chocolate-covered green chilies, so the crème de cacao was an obvious addition to complement the spirit. -TB

    notes: This was the first time I did the “Shannon thing” of combining bourbon, smoky scotch, and a crazy Jamaican rum. The whole thing was built around the Rum Fire rum, which is similar to Wray & Nephew. This Sazerac riff drinks like a Phil Spector song sounds—hence the name. -ST

    notes: This drink is similar to something my grandfather, who was from Modena, used to drink. I originally wanted to use white balsamic vinegar in this Manhattan variation, but Jonnie Long turned me on to aigre doux (sweet and sour), and I became obsessed with it. It adds this beguiling flavor that nobody can put their finger on. -CN

    notes: You could call this a carrot Negroni, with other earthy and vegetal flavors complementing the carrot eau-de-vie - artichoke from the Cynar and caraway from the aquavit. While the name evokes something divisive, the drink was more well received than I expected, and I still make it a lot when people ask for something bizarre but approachable. -ST

     - 1 ¼ ounces Beefeater gin
     - ½ ounce St. George green chile vodka 
     - ¼ ounce Clairin Vaval Haitian rum
     - ¾ ounce Dolin blanc vermouth 
     - 1 teaspoon Strega
     - 1 dash absinthe
     - 1 dash House Orange Bitters
     - Garnish: 1 orange twist
    steps:
     - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a chilled Nick & Nora glass. Express the orange twist over the drink, then place it in the drink.

    notes: I love a drink that's perfectly clear and served on a big rock, but it often doesn't work because those drinks die quickly on ice. White Negronis are the exception, but it's difficult to create a new White Negroni variation because there aren't a lot of clear bitter ingredients. Once I found the Luxardo Bitter Bianco, everything else fell into place, with the floral fruitiness of the plum eau-de-vie bridging the gin and the bright grapefruit liqueur. -SJ

    notes: With our luxury cocktails, we get the opportunity to work with ingredients made with the highest intention—we don't use expensive ingredients just for the sake of it. Monkey 47 gin is made in Germany and contains a whopping 47 botanicals; you can drink it neat, and it's an experience in itself. A classic Martini showcases the bartender's understanding of ingredients, and hopefully this drink does as well. Because Monkey 47 has a lighter, more delicate flavor profile, a traditional dry vermouth would bully it, so I used a plum wine instead. A teaspoon of mango brandy works as seasoning to lift the other flavors, like playing harmony under a solo. -JF
    ingredients:
     - 1½ ounces Monkey 47 Schwarzwald dry gin
     - ¼ ounces Tozai Blossom of Peace plum wine 
     - ¼ ounce Giffard Lichi-Li lychee liqueur

    notes: The first drink I put together for the opening of D&C Denver, this is essentially a Ravenmaster turned into a Martini. We serve it straight from the freezer with a very small amount of added water, to keep the rich texture and to let the pear and eucalyptus flavors shine. -TB
    ingredients:
     - 1¾ ounces Beefeater London dry gin
     - ¼ ounce Clear Creek pear eau-de-vie
     - 1 teaspoon Mathilde Poire pear liqueur
     - ¾ ounce Cocchi Americano
     - 1 drop Terra Spice eucalyptus extract 
     - Garnish: 1 lemon twist
    steps:
     - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a chilled Nick & Nora glass. Express the lemon twist over the drink and discard.

    notes: I love Tarantino movies, and I wanted my first D&C cocktail to be named after Tarantino's introduction into film. It's essentially a mezcal Negroni inspired by Scott Teague's Straight Razor. It's meant to be a slow sipper; as it dilutes, the flavors open up, the drink loses some of its bitterness, and it tastes brighter and more summery. -CJ

    notes: In the first Death & Co. book, there were a ton of variations on the Diamondback, which is basically a Manhattan with yellow Chartreuse instead of vermouth, so they're always preposterously boozy (and always named after snakes). Cobrafire is a high proof blanche Armagnac; the Pasquet Marie-Framboise lowers the proof and dries out the drink a bit. -MB

    notes: I was really into the cool combination of celery and coconut, so I worked it into this fun piña colada variation. Green Chartreuse is a perfect fit with celery, and tequila rounds it all out. Sabrosa is Spanish for "tasty"-and the name of a groovy Beastie Boys instrumental track. -JW
    ingredients:
     - 1½ ounces Siembra Valles Blanco tequila
     - ½ ounce green Chartreuse
     - ¼ ounce Velvet falernum
     - ¾ ounce Coco López cream of coconut
     - ½ ounce fresh celery juice 
     - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
     - Garnish: 1 mint bouquet
    steps:
     - Combine all the ingredients in a shaker and whip, shaking with a few pieces of crushed ice, just until incorporated. Dump into a tiki mug and fill the glass with crushed ice. Garnish with the mint bouquet and serve with a straw.

    notes: I threw so many names at Tyson for this drink, and I couldn't believe he went for this one. I learned a trick from a bartender at the NoMad restaurant, who told me that you can add dairy to a citrus cocktail if you include a green tea infusion, which keeps the dairy from breaking. -MH
    ingredients:
     - 2 ounces cold seltzer
     - 1½ ounces BarSol Acholado pisco 
     - ¼ ounce Avuá Prata cachaça
     - 1 ounce Tropic of Capricorn Greek Yogurt Syrup 
     - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - ¾ ounce Cinnamon Syrup 
     - Garnish: Tropic of Capricorn green tea leaves
    steps:
     - Pour the seltzer into a fizz glass. Short shake the remaining ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then double strain into the glass. Sprinkle some green tea leaves over the drink.

    notes: We had a ton of Paul Beau at the bar; few people come to Death & Co. and order a glass of super-expensive cognac. So I used it to create something lush, creamy, and nutty—a good after-dinner drink, but still citrusy and refreshing. -AJ
    ingredients:
     - 1 ounce Paul Beau Hors d'Age cognac
     - 1 ounce Brugal 1888 rum
     - 1 ounce Vanilla Syrup
     - ¼ ounce El Maestro Sierra 15-year oloroso sherry 
     - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - 1 egg white
     - ½ teaspoon Caffo Amaretto
    steps:
     - Dry shake all the ingredients, then shake again with ice. Double strain into a chilled coupe. No garnish.

    notes: Developing this drink was such a pain in the ass. Originally, I wanted to make something that tasted like drinking a carrot cake. I love peanuts and sherry together, and I've worked a lot with peanut-infused sherry, so I tried pairing it with carrot eau de-vie, but I couldn't get it to work. This drink taught me that sometimes you have to let go of what you want a drink to be and just allow it to show you what it wants to be. So l swapped in cognac, but it was boring and flat. Tyson suggested adding a little aquavit, and suddenly-finally-it worked. -AJ
    ingredients:
     - ¾ ounce Pierre Ferrand ambré cognac
     - ¾ ounce Linie aquavit 
     - ¾ ounce Peanut-Infused Lustau Don Nuño Oloroso Sherry
     - ½ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
     - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
     - 1 barspoon mascarpone cheese
     - Garnish: 1 piece of peanut brittle
    steps:
     - Shake all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a double old-fashioned glass and fill the glass with crushed ice. Garnish with the peanut brittle and serve with a straw.

    notes: One of the bartenders had used a blend of crème de pêche and menthe-pastille in a cocktail, and someone got overexcited and made 3 quarts of the batch, so we had tons of it left over. I developed this drink so we could use it up. I love the way peach, mint, and dill go together, and the Elijah Craig picks up the dill perfectly. For texture and tang, I added Greek yogurt. The name is a nod to the Steve Miller Band, but I also think this drink is way out there. -JW
    ingredients:
     - 1½ ounces Elijah Craig 12-year bourbon
     - ½ ounce Gamle Ode dill aquavit 
     - 1 teaspoon Massenez crème de pêche peach liqueur 
     - ½ teaspoon Giffard menthe-pastille 
     - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice 
     - ½ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
     - 1 teaspoon Greek yogurt
    steps:
     - Shake all the ingredients with ice, then double strain into a chilled coupe. No garnish.

    notes: There are only a few classic drinks made with orange juice—including the mimosa, the Monkey Gland, and the screwdriver—so there's not a lot of fertile ground for inspiration. So I found my muse in an Orange Julius, taking the flavors of the frozen treat and "adultifying" them. -JA
    ingredients:
     - 3 ounces fresh orange juice
     - 1½ ounces Banks 5-Island white rum
     - 1 ounce Vanilla Syrup
     - 1 ounce heavy cream
     - 1 teaspoon acid phosphate
     - 5 drops orange flower water
     - Garnish: 1 orange wedge
    steps:
     - Dry shake all the ingredients, then shake again with ice. Double strain into a Collins glass. Garnish with the orange wedge and serve with a straw.

    notes: 
     - I'm still haunted by the experience of cracking hundreds of eggs, and blending gallons of dairy and pounds of sugar for these batches. Though it does make me smile a little bit knowing that the Death & Co. New York team is suffering through the same prep every holiday season, our guests would crucify us if we didn't put it on the menu. Due to high demand, it's tough for us to keep up with the long aging process, but if you have the patience, let this nog age for a few months, and the flavor and texture will change drastically over time. -TB
     - Makes about 30 cocktails.
    ingredients:
     - 50 ounces white sugar
     - 30 ounces whole milk
     - 33 eggs
     - One 750 ml bottle Old Grand-Dad 114 bourbon
     - 12½ ounces Smith & Cross Jamaicia rum
     - 12½ ounces Blandy's 5-year Malmsey madeira
     - 12½ ounces Pierre Ferrand ambré cognac
     - 20 ounces heavy cream
    steps:
     - Working in batches, blend the sugar and milk until the sugar is dissolved. Transfer to a large container. Working in batches, blend the eggs and milk mixture at low speed until the eggs are well blended. Transfer to another container and add the remaining ingredients. Pour the mixture from one container to another a few times until well blended. Funnel into bottles and age in the refrigerator for at least 2 weeks (and up to 2 years!) before serving.
